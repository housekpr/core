# Distance Sensors

If you would like to have to measure the level of the water tank, you can use an ultrasonic distance sensors. Depending on the tank setup you could go for the well established HC-SR04 model. It is a safe bet, but it is not whater or even weather proof by default.

## Waterpoof distance sensors

In case you would like to have water or at least weather proof sensor, you need to look carefully. The list below is not covering all options, but focuses on the most common entry level models, which are tested or should be interchangable and should work with the default code of the project, based only on their spec.

| Sensor | Status | Additional notes |
|---|--- |---|
| JSN-SR04T-2.0 | Tested | Has 20cm blind spot. Entry level, might be good idea to order at least two and test in case of strange readings. |
| JSN-SR20-Y1 | Should work | Entry level sensor. Should be directly interchangable. |

Any other sensor following same protocol may be compatible.
